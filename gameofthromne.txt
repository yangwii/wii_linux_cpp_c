I Am Guilty Of A Far More Monstrous Crime. I Am Guilty Of Being A Dwarf. 
I've Been On Trial For That My Entire Life! 
I Did Not Do It, I Did Not Kill Joffrey But I WISH That I Had! Watching Your Vicious Bastard Die Gave Me More Relief Than A Thousand Lying Whores! 
I Wish I Was The Monster You Think I Am, I Wish I Had Enough Poison For The Whole Pack Of You, 
I Would Gladly Give My Life To Watch You ALL Swallow It! I Will NOT Give MY Life For Joffrey's Murder And I Know I'll Get No Justice Here,
So I Will Let The Gods Decide My Fate. I Demand A Trial By Combat!" - Tyrion Lannister
